# Bypassing_Ransomware

A few weeks later, I received a notification that one of the servers that had been affected by the Log4j vulnerability had been compromised. The server was used to store sensitive customer data, and I knew that I had to act quickly to prevent the data from being stolen.

I started by running a scan of the server to see what files had been accessed. I found that the attackers had accessed a number of files, including some that contained customer names, addresses, and social security numbers.

I then used a brute force script to crack the password that the attackers had used to access the server. Once I had the password, I was able to delete the files that the attackers had accessed.

I then restored the server to its original state and notified the team leads of the incident. The team leads were grateful for my quick action, and they were able to notify the affected customers of the breach.

I was proud of my work in resolving the server compromise, and I knew that I had made a difference in protecting customer data. I was also excited to continue my work with the Shields Up: Cybersecurity program, and I knew that I was learning valuable skills that would help me in my future career.
